BC = Beauty Contest

* This doesn't tell you which colour trophy it won.

* NB: Your Neopet may have BC trophies from before its creation (i.e it was purged and then recreased afterwards)

### Requirements

* Python 3.11.7 (lower may also be fine)

* ``pip install httpx`` (for making HTTP requests asynchronously)
